## About Project 
Our telemedicine platform empowers patients to receive expert treatment from the comfort of their homes. We've integrated a cancer prediction system using machine learning for enhanced healthcare insights. Users, both doctors and patients, create accounts with accurate information to schedule appointments for a nominal fee. Consultations are conducted via video conferencing. With our reliable system, we aim to expand telemedicine access nationwide, providing affordable, high-quality care. Join us in making a positive impact on healthcare accessibility for all.
